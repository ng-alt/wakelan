					       Version 1.0


Got a fancy new PC with wake-on-lan?  Want to boot it in the middle of the
night to back it up?  Or just too lazy to get off your couch to boot your other
machine?  Well this package is for you!

WakeLan sends a properly formatted UDP packet across the network which will
cause a wake-on-lan enabled computer to power on.  You'll need to find out the
MAC address of your PC.  Under linux ifconfig is useful to discover this
information, windoze users can use winipcfg.


INSTALLATION

To install, simply:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

If you've got one host that you like to wake up by default you can use the
DEFAULTMAC macro, to select the network you want to broadcast to you can use
the DEFAULTTARGET macro.


USAGE

Usage: ./wakelan [options] [mac] [broadcast] [port]
    -b addr    broadcast address
    -m mac     mac address of host
    -p port    UDP port to broadcast to
    -v[v]      version

By default the broadcast is 255.255.255.255, and the default port is 32767


EXAMPLES

    ./wakelan
    ./wakelan 05:5a:ef:97:12:88
    ./wakelan 32:5f:9a:ed:30:15 10.255.255.255
    ./wakelan -b mynet-bcast -m 5:e:72:a:32:00


AVAILABILITY

Hopefully this package will end up at

    ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Network/misc/wakelan-1.0.tar.gz
